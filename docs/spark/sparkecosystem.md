1. Spark Core Engine: The foundation of the entire Spark ecosystem, the Spark Core, handles essential functions such as task scheduling, monitoring, and basic I/O operations. It also provides the core programming abstraction, Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs).
2. Cluster Management: Spark's versatility allows for cluster management by multiple tools, including Hadoop YARN, Apache Mesos, or Spark's built-in standalone cluster manager. This flexibility accommodates varying requirements and operational contexts.
3. Library: The Spark ecosystem includes a rich set of libraries:
a. Spark SQL allows SQL-like queries on RDDs or data from external sources, integrating relational processing with Spark's functional programming API.
b. Spark MLlib is a library for machine learning that provides various algorithms and utilities.
c. Spark GraphX allows for the construction and computation on graphs, facilitating advanced data visualization and graph computation.
d. Spark Streaming makes it easy to build scalable, high-throughput, fault-tolerant streaming applications that can handle live data streams alongside batch processing.
4. Polyglot Programming: Spark supports programming in multiple languages including Python, Java, Scala, and R. This broad language support makes Spark accessible to a wide range of developers and data scientists.
5. Storage Flexibility: Spark can interface with a variety of storage systems, including HDFS, Amazon S3, local filesystems, and more. It also supports interfacing with both SQL and NoSQL databases, providing broad flexibility for various data storage and processing needs.
