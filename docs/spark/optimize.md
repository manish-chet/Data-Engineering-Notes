### Code Level Optimization

1. Use DataFrames/Datasets instead of RDDs: DataFrames and Datasets have optimized execution plans, leading to faster and more memory-efficient operations than RDDs. They also have more intuitive APIs for many operations.

2. Leverage Broadcasting: If you're performing an operation like a join between a large DataFrame and a small DataFrame, consider broadcasting the smaller DataFrame. Broadcasting sends the smaller DataFrame to all worker nodes, so they have a local copy and don't need to fetch the data across the network.

3. Avoid Shuffling: Operations like groupByKey cause shuffling, where data is transferred across the network, which can be slow. Operations like reduceByKey or aggregateByKey reduce the amount of data that needs to be shuffled, and can be faster.

4. Avoid Collecting Large Data: Be careful with operations like collect() that bring a large amount of data into the driver program, which could cause an out of memory error.

5. Repartitioning and Coalescing: Depending on your use case, you might want to increase or decrease the number of partitions. If you have too many small partitions, use coalesce to combine them. If you have too few large partitions, use repartition to split them.

6. Persist/Cache Wisely: Persist or cache the DataFrames or RDDs that you'll reuse. However, keep in mind that these operations consume memory, so use them judiciously.

### Resource Configuration Optimization

1. Tune Memory Parameters: Make sure to set spark.driver.memory, spark.executor.memory, spark.memory.fraction, and spark.memory.storageFraction based on the memory requirements of your application and the capacity of your hardware.

2. Control Parallelism: Use spark.default.parallelism and spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to control the number of tasks during operations like join, reduceByKey, etc. Too many tasks can cause a lot of overhead, but too few tasks might not fully utilize your cluster.

3. Dynamic Allocation: If your cluster manager supports it, use dynamic resource allocation, which allows Spark to dynamically adjust the resources your application occupies based on the workload. This means that if your application has stages that require lots of resources, they can be allocated dynamically.

        spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled true 
        spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors 2 
        spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors 1 
        spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors 20
        spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout 1m 
        spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout 2m 
        spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout 2min
        spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled is set to true to enable dynamic allocation.
        spark.dynamicAllocation.initialExecutors is set to 2 to specify that initially, two executors will be allocated.
        spark.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors and spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors control the minimum and maximum number of executors, respectively.
        spark.dynamicAllocation.schedulerBacklogTimeout and spark.dynamicAllocation.sustainedSchedulerBacklogTimeout control how long a backlog of tasks Spark will tolerate before adding more executors.
        spark.dynamicAllocation.executorIdleTimeout controls how long an executor can be idle before Spark removes it.


### Resource Configuration Optimization

1. Tune Garbage Collection: Spark uses the JVM, so the garbage collector can significantly affect performance. You can use spark.executor.extraJavaOptions to pass options to the JVM to tune the garbage collection.

2. Use Appropriate Data Structures: Parquet and Avro are both columnar data formats that are great for analytical queries and schema evolution. If your data processing patterns match these, consider using these formats.
