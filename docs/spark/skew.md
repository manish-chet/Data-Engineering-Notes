Data skewness in Spark occurs when the data is not evenly distributed across partitions. This often happens when certain keys in your data have many more values than others. Consequently, tasks associated with these keys take much longer to run than others, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and longer overall job execution time.

Here are a few scenarios where data skewness can occur:

1. Join Operations: When you perform a join operation on two datasets based on a key, and some keys have significantly more values than others, these keys end up having larger partitions. The tasks processing these larger partitions will take longer to complete.

2. GroupBy Operations: Similar to join operations, when you perform a groupByKey or reduceByKey operation, and some keys have many more values than others, data skewness can occur.

3. Data Distribution: If the data distribution is not uniform, such that certain partitions get more data than others, then data skewness can occur. This could happen due to the nature of the data itself or the partitioning function not distributing the data evenly.

### How to deal with data skewness 
Handling data skewness is a common challenge in distributed computing frameworks like Apache Spark. Here are some popular techniques to mitigate it:
1. Salting: Salting involves adding a random component to a skewed key to create additional unique keys. After performing the operation (like a join), the extra key can be dropped to get back to the original data.

2. Splitting skewed data: Identify the skewed keys and process them separately. For instance, you can filter out the skewed keys and perform a separate operation on them.

3. Increasing the number of partitions: Increasing the number of partitions can distribute the data more evenly. However, this might increase the overhead of managing more partitions.

4. Using reduceByKey instead of groupByKey: reduceByKey performs local aggregation before shuffling the data, which reduces the data transferred over the network.

5. Using Broadcast Variables: When joining a large DataFrame with a small DataFrame, you can use broadcast variables to send a copy of the small DataFrame to all nodes. This avoids shuffling of the large DataFrame.
