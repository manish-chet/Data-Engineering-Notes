When u start a spark shell, application driver creates the spark session in your local machine which request to Resource Manager present in cluster to create Yarn application. YARN Resource Manager start an Application Master (AM container). For client mode Application Master acts as the Executor launcher. Application Master will reach to Resource Manager and request for further containers. 
Resource manager will allocate new containers. These executors will directly communicate with Drivers which is present in the system in which you have submitted the spark application.
