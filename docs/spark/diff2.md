| **Criteria**         | **RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**                                           | **DataFrame**                                                                                    | **DataSet**                                                                                    |

| **Abstraction**      | Low level, provides a basic and simple abstraction.                               | High level, built on top of RDDs. Provides a structured and tabular view on data.                | High level, built on top of DataFrames. Provides a structured and strongly-typed view on data. |
| **Type Safety**      | Provides compile-time type safety, since it is based on objects.                  | Doesn't provide compile-time type safety, as it deals with semi-structured data.                 | Provides compile-time type safety, as it deals with structured data.                           |
| **Optimization**     | Optimization needs to be manually done by the developer (like using `mapreduce`). | Makes use of Catalyst Optimizer for optimization of query plans, leading to efficient execution. | Makes use of Catalyst Optimizer for optimization.                                              |
| **Processing Speed** | Slower, as operations are not optimized.                                          | Faster than RDDs due to optimization by Catalyst Optimizer.                                      | Similar to DataFrame, it's faster due to Catalyst Optimizer.                                   |
| **Ease of Use**      | Less easy to use due to the need of manual optimization.                          | Easier to use than RDDs due to high-level abstraction and SQL-like syntax.                       | Similar to DataFrame, it provides SQL-like syntax which makes it easier to use.                |
| **Interoperability** | Easy to convert to and from other types like DataFrame and DataSet.               | Easy to convert to and from other types like RDD and DataSet.                                    | Easy to convert to and from other types like DataFrame and RDD.                                |
