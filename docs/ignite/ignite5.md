### Zero SPOF

In any distributed system, node failure should be expected, particularly as the size of the cluster grows. The Zero Single Point of Failure (SPOF) design pattern ensures that no single part of a system can stop the entire cluster or system from working. Sometimes, the system using master-slave replication or the mixed master-master system falls into this category. Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the Hadoop NameNode was an SPOF in an HDFS cluster. Netflix has calculated the revenue loss for each ms of downtime or latency, and it is not small at all. Most businesses do not want single points of failure for the obvious reason. Apache Ignite, as a horizontally scalable distributed system, is designed in such way that all nodes in the cluster are equal, you can read and write from any node in the cluster. There are no master-slave communications in the Ignite cluster. Data is backed up or replicated across the cluster so that failure of any node doesn't bring down the entire cluster or the application. This way Ignite provides a dynamic form of High Availability. Another benefit of this approach is the ease at which new nodes can be added. When new nodes join the cluster, they can take over a portion of data from the existing nodes. Because all nodes are the same, this communication can happen seamlessly in a running cluster.
