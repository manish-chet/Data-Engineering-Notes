# Apache Ignite

Apache Ignite provides a convenient and easy-to-use interface for developers to work with large-scale data sets in real time and other aspects of in-memory computing.

## Features

Apache Ignite has the following features:

1. Data grid
2. Compute grid
3. Service grid
4. Bigdata accelerator
5. Streaming grid

The following figure illustrates the basic features of Apache Ignite:

## Primary Capabilities

- Elasticity: An Apache Ignite cluster can grow horizontally by adding new nodes.
- Persistence: Apache Ignite data grid can persist cache entries in RDBMS, even in NoSQL like MongoDB or Cassandra.
- Cache as a Service (CaaS): Apache Ignite supports Cache-as-a-Service across the organization which allows multiple applications from different departments to access managed in-memory cache instead of slow disk base databases.
- 2ⁿ Level Cache: Apache Ignite is the perfect caching tier to use as a 2ⁿ level cache in Hibernate and MyBatis.
- High-performance Hadoop accelerator: Apache Ignite can replace Hadoop task tracker and job tracker and HDFS to increase the performance of big data analysis.
- Share state in-memory across Spark applications: Ignite RDD allows easily sharing of state in-memory between different Spark jobs or applications. With Ignite in-memory shared RDD's, any Spark application can put data into Ignite cache which will be accessible by another Spark application later.
- Distributed computing: Apache Ignite provides a set of simple APIs that allows a user to distribute computation and data processing across multiple nodes in the cluster to gain high performance. Apache Ignite distributed services is very useful to develop and execute microservice like architecture.
- Streaming: Apache Ignite allows processing continuous never-ending streams of data in scalable and fault-tolerant fashion in-memory, rather than analyzing the data after it has been stored in the database.
