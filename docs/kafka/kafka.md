# Apache Kafka Overview

**Apache Kafka** is a distributed event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was originally developed at LinkedIn and later open-sourced through the Apache Software Foundation.

##  Key Features

- **Publish/Subscribe Messaging**: Producers send messages to topics; consumers read them in real time.
- **Scalable**: Kafka can handle millions of messages per second across a distributed cluster.
- **Durable**: Data is written to disk and replicated for high availability.
- **Stream Processing**: Native support with Kafka Streams and integrations with tools like Apache Flink and Spark.

##  Common Use Cases

- Centralized log aggregation
- Real-time data analytics
- Event-driven microservices
- ETL pipelines and data lake ingestion
- Website activity tracking

> Kafka is at the core of many modern data architectures due to its speed, reliability, and scalability.
