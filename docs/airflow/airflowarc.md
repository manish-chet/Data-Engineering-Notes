### Airflow Architecture

## **Scheduler**
The scheduler is a critical component of Airflow. Its primary function is to continuously scan the DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) directory to identify and schedule tasks based on their dependencies and specified time intervals. The scheduler is responsible for determining which tasks to execute and when. It interacts with the metadata database to store and retrieve task state and execution information.
## **Metadata Database**
Airflow leverages a metadata database, such as PostgreSQL or MySQL, to store all the configuration details, task states, and execution metadata. The metadata database provides persistence and ensures that Airflow can recover from failures and resume tasks from their last known state. It also serves as a central repository for managing and monitoring task execution.
## **Web Server**
The web server component provides a user interface for interacting with Airflow. It enables users to monitor task execution, view the status of DAGs, and access logs and other operational information. The web server communicates with the metadata database to fetch relevant information and presents it in a user-friendly manner. Users can trigger manual task runs, monitor task progress, and configure Airflow settings through the web server interface.
## **Executors**
Airflow supports different executor types to execute tasks. The executor is responsible for allocating resources and running tasks on the specified worker nodes.

!!! example

    the local executor executes tasks on the same node as the scheduler, while the Kubernetes executor executes tasks in containers.

## **Worker Nodes**
Worker nodes are responsible for executing the tasks assigned to them by the executor. They retrieve the task details, dependencies, and code from the metadata database and execute the tasks accordingly. The number of worker nodes can be scaled up or down based on the workload and resource requirements.
## **Message Queue**
Airflow relies on a message queue system, such as RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Redis, to enable communication between the scheduler and the worker nodes. The scheduler places task execution requests in the message queue, and the worker nodes pick up these requests, execute the tasks, and update their status back to the metadata database. The message queue acts as a communication channel, ensuring reliable task distribution and coordination.
## **DAGs and Tasks**
DAGs are at the core of Airflowâ€™s architecture. A DAG is a directed graph consisting of interconnected tasks. Each task represents a unit of work within the data pipeline. Tasks can have dependencies on other tasks, defining the order in which they should be executed. Airflow uses the DAG structure to determine task dependencies, schedule task execution, and track their progress.

Each task within a DAG is associated with an operator, which defines the type of work to be performed. Airflow provides a rich set of built-in operators for common tasks like file operations, data processing, and database interactions. Additionally, custom operators can be created to cater to specific requirements.
Tasks within a DAG can be triggered based on various events, such as time-based schedules, the completion of other tasks, or the availability of specific data.
