### What is Orchestration in BigData?
Orchestration in big data refers to the automated configuration, coordination, and management of complex big data systems and services. Like an orchestra conductor ensures each section of the orchestra plays its part at the right time and the right way to create harmonious music, orchestration in big data ensures that each component of a big data system interacts in the correct manner at the right time to execute complex, multi-step processes efficiently and reliably.
In practical terms, orchestration involves:

1. Workflow management: It defines, schedules, and manages workflows involving multiple tasks across disparate systems. These workflows can be simple linear sequences or complex directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with branching and merging paths.
2. Task scheduling: Orchestration tools schedule tasks based on their dependencies. This ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order and that tasks that can run in parallel do so, increasing overall system efficiency.
3. Failure handling: Orchestration tools handle failures in the system, either by retrying failed tasks, skipping them, or alerting operators to the failure.


### Need of Workflow/Dependency management while Designing Data Pipelines
Workflow or dependency management is a crucial component in the design of data pipelines, especially in the context of big data.

1. Ordering and Scheduling: Data processing tasks often have dependencies, meaning one task needs to complete before another can begin. For example, a task that aggregates data may need to wait until the data has been extracted and cleaned. A workflow management system can keep track of these dependencies and ensure tasks are executed in the right order.
2. Parallelization: When tasks don't have dependencies, they can often run in parallel. This can significantly speed up data processing. Workflow management systems can manage parallel execution, maximizing the use of computational resources and reducing overall processing time.
3. Error Handling: If a task in a data pipeline fails, it can have a knock-on effect on other tasks. Workflow management systems can handle these situations, for instance by retrying failed tasks, skipping them, or stopping the pipeline and alerting operators.
4. Visibility and Monitoring: Workflow management systems often provide tools for monitoring the progress of data pipelines and visualizing their structure. This can make it easier to spot bottlenecks or failures, and to understand the flow of data through the pipeline.
5. Resource Management: Workflow management systems can allocate resources (like memory, CPU, etc.) depending on the requirements of different tasks. This helps in efficiently utilizing resources and ensures optimal performance of tasks.


### What is AirFlow?
Apache Airflow is an open-source platform that programmatically allows you to author, schedule, and monitor workflows. It was originally developed by Airbnb in 2014 and later became a part of the Apache Software Foundation's project catalog.
Airflow uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to manage workflow orchestration. DAGs are a set of tasks with directional dependencies, where the tasks are the nodes in the graph, and the dependencies are the edges. In other words, each task in the workflow executes based on the completion status of its predecessors.

Key features of Apache Airflow include:

1. Dynamic Pipeline Creation: Airflow allows you to create dynamic pipelines using Python. This provides flexibility and can be adapted to complex dependencies and operations.
2. Easy Scheduling: Apache Airflow includes a scheduler to execute tasks at defined intervals. The scheduling syntax is quite flexible, allowing for complex scheduling.
3. Robust Monitoring and Logging: Airflow provides detailed status and logging information about each task, facilitating debugging and monitoring. It also offers a user-friendly UI to monitor and manage the workflow.
4. Scalability: Airflow can distribute tasks across a cluster of workers, meaning it can scale to handle large workloads.
5. Extensibility: Airflow supports custom plugins and can integrate with several big data technologies. You can define your own operators and executors, extend the library, and even use the user interface API.
6. Failure Management: In case of a task failure, Airflow sends alerts and allows for retries and catchup of past runs in a robust way
